# TuringEmulator
## What is it?
TuringEmulator is a little Java Project which, surprisingly, emulates a Turing Machine.

The essential point and purpose of this project distinguishing it from others is the possibility to emulate
a somehow universal Turing Machine, which means the program can emulate different Turing Machines
without changing the code. I don't mean to say _any_ kind of TuringMachine, as there are some limitations regarding the
Turing Machine.

## TODO
* Improving this humble Readme
* adding simple user interaction
